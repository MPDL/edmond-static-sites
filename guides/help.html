      <h2><strong>Data Publishing</strong></h2>

      <div id="DOI"></div>
      <h3>Does Edmond provide Digital Object Identifiers (DOI)?</h3>
      Yes, Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) are automatically provided for each dataset. The DOI is immediately
      reserved by creating a dataset. When a dataset is published, the DOI will then resolve. The DOI is always
      resolving towards the newest version of a dataset.

      <div id="DOI-reserve"></div>

      Yes, Edmond does this automatically. For each new dataset, a DOI will be reserved.

      <div id="Benefits"></div>
      <h3>What are the benefits of depositing my research data?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your data will be preserved, even for your own future use.</li>
        <li>The publishing process creates a permanent record with a persistent identifier and a suggested citation, so
          that your work can be formally attributed when re-analysed by others.</li>
        <li>Your data will be discoverable through search engines to maximize visibility and impact.</li>
        <li>By providing access to your research data, you can fulfil the requirements of scientific journals, financial
          sponsors and other parties who have supported your research.</li>
      </ul>

      <div id="Why-Use"></div>
      <h3>Why should I use Edmond for publishing my data?</h3>
      Edmond is hosted by the Max Planck Digital Library, which means your data will not leave the Max Planck Society.
      The use of Edmond and the Edmond support is free of charge.

      <div id="MPG-author"></div>
      <h3>How many MPG authors are needed to publish research data with Edmond?</h3>
      It is fully sufficient, that one author of the dataset has an MPG affiliation.

      <div id="Reviewer"></div>
      <h3>How can I share my dataset with others before publishing the dataset?</h3>
      You can create a private URL for your unpublished dataset. With this link anyone can access your dataset without
      login. You can use this link i.e. to share it for a review process, when reviewers want to see your unpublished
      data
      in advance. For a detailed description of how to create a private link to your dataset, please see the following
      <a href="https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/user/dataset-management.html#private-url-to-review-unpublished-dataset"
        target="_blank">section in the Dataverse Guide</a>.

      <div id="Communication"></div>
      <h3>Which data handling processes are defined for Edmond?</h3>
      Edmond employs principles of the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model. Details are outlined in <a

        presentation on the Data Handling Processes in Edmond</a>.

      <div id="Published-datasets"></div>
      <h3>Who can search and access a published dataset?</h3>
      When you published your dataset, anyone can search and access it. Edmond is an Open Research Data Repository,
      which
      includes openness by design.

      <div id="Withdraw"></div>
      <h3>Can I withdraw my published dataset?</h3>
      Yes, it is possible to withdraw a dataset after it was published. This can be done via the menu "Edit Dataset" and
      then the button "Deaccession Dataset". It is necessary to give a comment on why the dataset will be withdrawn.
      After that,
      only metadata and your comment are available for other users, but not your files anymore. The DOI is still
      resolving.

      <div id="Cite"></div>
      <h3>How can I cite a published dataset?</h3>
      You can find a citation suggestion for the dataset at the top of the dataset page. You can also download the
      citation in different file formats.

      <br><br>
      <h2><strong>Datasets</strong></h2>

      <div id="Dataset-information"></div>

        <li>Institution</li>
        <li>Study Type</li>
      </ul>

      <div id="File-structure"></div>
      <h3>Can I use a folder structure for my dataset?</h3>
      Yes, a folder structure is possible. You can generate the folder structure with different files in it. The <a

      structure in an Edmond dataset might be <a href="https://doi.org/10.17617/3.7m"
        target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.17617/3.7m</a>.

      <div id="Dataset-delete"></div>
      <h3>Can I delete a dataset that I have created?</h3>
      Yes, an unpublished dataset can be deleted. All information and files will be deleted and cannot be restored.
      A published dataset cannot be deleted, only withdrawn. Please see the <a href="#Withdraw">description here</a>.

      <div id="Dataset-published"></div>
      <h3>Can I make changes to my published dataset?</h3>
      Yes, changes on published datasets are always possible. You can i.e. add or delete files and also edit metadata.
      All
      will lead to a new version of the dataset, which needs to be published again. Depending on the changes, minor or
      major release versions of the dataset are available. The new version will receive a new DOI. Thereby it is fully
      available and citable.

      <div id="Versioning"></div>
      <h3>Does Edmond provide versioning for datasets?</h3>
      Yes, Edmond provides versioning of datasets. For published datasets you can select between minor and major
      versions, i.e. 1.1 or 2.0 and so on. For more information, please see the following <a
        href="https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/user/dataset-management.html#dataset-versions"
        target="_blank">section in the Dataverse Guide</a>.

      <div id="Dataset-license"></div>
      <h3>Under what licenses can I publish a dataset?</h3>
      Edmond supports flexible licensing. Following licenses are recommended:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank"> Creative Commons </a> <br>
          Creative Commons licenses were originally created for the legally secure licensing of creative content, not
          primarily for data. But since version 4, this slightly different nature of data is kept in mind so that CC-BY
          4.0
          and CC-BY- SA 4.0 are also usable for research data. The advantage of CC licenses is their wide distribution
          and
          awareness. <br>
          By licensing your research outputs under CC-BY, your research is openly available, but it is required that
          others have to give you credit, in the form of a citation, should they use or refer to your research object.
          <br>
          This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as
          they
          credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for
          maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/" target="_blank"> Open Data Commons </a> <br>
          Open Data Commons has developed standard licenses directly for data, therefore they are likely to fit a bit
          better. But they are just not as widespread as CC licenses.
        </li>
        <li> Public Domain <br>
          Not uncommon is the use of public domain waivers as <a
            href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">CC0</a> or Open Data Commons <a
            href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/" target="_blank">Public Domain Dedication and License
            (PDDL)</a> for research data. Here, the greatest possible freedom is granted in handling the data. Depending
          on the type of data, this can be useful, but it also leaves possibilities to misuse the data. <br>
          Although CC0 does not legally require users of the data to cite the source, it does not take away the moral
          responsibility to give attribution, as is common in scientific research.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.govdata.de/lizenzen" target="_blank">Datenlizenz Deutschland</a> <br>
          Through a collaboration between federal, state and municipal associations, Datenlizenz Deutschland has
          developed
          a recommendation for uniform conditions for the use of administrative data in Germany, which now exists as
          "data
          license Germany" in version 2.0. This version is officially accepted as an open license by the Council of
          Experts of the <a href="https://opendefinition.org/" target="_blank">Open Definition</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      A tabular overview of the different licenses can be found on the German page <a
        href="http://forschungslizenzen.de/" target="_blank">“Forschungslizenzen”</a>.<br>
      If no license is manually assigned, the data within Edmond will automatically be released to the public domain
      under
      <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank"> CC0</a>.

      <div id="Explore"></div>
      <h3>Can I explore data on Edmond with other services?</h3>
      Yes, it is possible to explore the published data on Edmond with other services. Edmond mainly supports the <a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank">Mybinder service</a> and <a href="https://wholetale.org" target="_blank">Whole Tale</a>. If you want to start data in Mybinder, please select "Dataverse" as the starting repository and enter the corresponding DOI of the dataset. The Mybinder service can then be launched. For analysis in Whole Tale, you must first register the desired data in your workspace. Please see the <a href="https://wholetale.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users_guide/manage.html" target="_blank">corresponding Whole Tale instructions</a>.

      <h2><strong>Files</strong></h2>

      <div id="Items-type"></div>
      <h3>What types of data files can I upload?</h3>
      You can upload all types of data files. There is no limitation. Of course, it should be in formats that are reasonable for the use and reuse of your dataset. You can also upload your software code. For recommendations regarding file
      formats please visit our <a href="https://rdm.mpdl.mpg.de/before-research/file-formats/"
        target="_blank">Information Platform on Research Data Management</a>.

      <div id="Limits"></div>
      <h3>What are the size limits?</h3>
      There are no size limits in Edmond. But please note that uploading large amounts of files via the browser can be
      time-consuming depending on the infrastructure. The command line client <a href="#Client">DVUploader</a> is
      specially designed to upload
      large files into Edmond. An example can be found in the <a href="#command-line">Technical FAQs</a>. Please contact
      our <a href="#" onclick="_2edmond();return false;" target="_blank">Edmond
        support team</a> if you have any questions.<br>
      If you would like to publish very large amounts of data, you are welcome to contact our <a href="#"
        onclick="_2edmond();return false;" target="_blank">Edmond
        support team</a>.

      <div id="Zip"></div>
      <h3>Can I upload a zip file instead of many single files?</h3>
      Yes, you can. For bigger sets of file items we recommend this solution instead of many single files.
      With an integrated ZIP viewer, the ZIP archives can directly be viewed on Edmond.
      The folder structure including files of a ZIP archive will automatically be displayed.
      At the same time, individual files can also be downloaded from the ZIP archive, so that it is no longer necessary
      to download the entire ZIP file.
      This gives users a quicker insight into the published ZIP file.

      <div id="direct-download"></div>
      <h3>How can I use direct download links to file items?</h3>
      Edmond offers direct download links to file items. If you select the CC0 license for your dataset, the direct link
      for each file item will be displayed in the metadata section.<br>
      A direct download for the whole dataset can be generated with
      http://edmond.mpdl.mpg.de/api/access/dataset/:persistentId?persistentId=doi:10.17617/ plus the last numbers and
      digits of the datasets DOI.

      <div id="File-delete"></div>
      <h3>How can I delete a file?</h3>
      Deleting an item from a published dataset will lead to a new version of the general dataset. See also the answer
      on <a href="#Versioning">versioning in Edmond</a>. Please note that the file is still available in the previous
      version.

      <div id="File-move"></div>
      <h3>How can I move a file?</h3>
      You can move a file on the file level. This is possible via edit metadata, where also the "File Path" is
      available.
      Through this, moving a file to different folders is possible.

      <div id="Jupyter"></div>
      <h3>Are there special features for Jupyter notebooks?</h3>
      Yes, we offer additional features for datasets with Jupyter notebooks. Datasets with data and and a .jypnb file can be executed in the <a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank"></a>Mybinder service</a>. In addition, a Mybinder button can also be integrated into the dataset description. 
      The following html syntax is necessary for this, whereby XXX must be replaced by the dataset DOI:
      <br><code>
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybinder.org/v2/dataverse/10.17617/XXX/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      </code><br>
      This allows the dataset to be started directly in Mybinder without the user having to set the Mybinder configurations. When this is entered, the Mybinder button appears in the desired position in the description, like this <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/dataverse/10.17617/3.QLWR38/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg" class="img-responsive"></a>
