    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>
        Edmond Repository is a service for the publication of research data. It is provided by Max Planck Digital
        Library (MPDL) on behalf of Max Planck Society. Therefore the <a
            href="https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/en/services/tos.html" target="_blank">Terms of Service of the Max Planck
        Digital Library</a> are valid for Edmond. <br />
        Edmond’s aim is to provide a platform for granting access to valuable research data and to promote the
        accessibility of these data. It may be used by uploading content to Edmond Repository (submitter) and by
        downloading (and using) content from Edmond Repository (downloader).
    </p>

    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>
        Edmond is a repository for research data, which is data that is created during scientific research in all
        fields of scholarship. Also negative results and other data that does not lead to a publication are welcome.
        All other sorts of data are not allowed to be uploaded in Edmond. In case it is not clear for you whether
        your data is research data or not, please contact the <a href="mailto:edmond@mpdl.mpg.de" target="_blank">Edmond
        support</a> before depositing the data. <br />
        MPDL services do not pre-screen any content and are not obliged to do so. But we reserve the right to review
        content and may delete or remove content without notice from the platform in case it is considered
        inappropriate in its sole discretion, it is not related to scientific research or violates the <a
            href="https://www.mpg.de/197494/rulesScientificPractice.pdf" target="_blank">Rules
        of Good Scientific Practice</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Registration</h2>
    <p>
        The Edmond Service is free of charge for all employees of the Max Planck Society and its scientific project
        partners for data from research projects. It is not allowed to exploit this service for data other than
        those arising from research projects associated with the Max Planck Society.
    </p>

    <h2>Scope of Access</h2>
    <p>
        The aim of putting content into Edmond is to publish it. But it is submitter’s choice to publish the content
        immediately or make it in a first step only available to specific users including authors/right-holders and
        explicitly named users like publishers. These users can at a minimum view and download the data.
        Content, once published, will be kept and made available for at least ten years. Once published, submitter
        has no possibility to erase the content but may withdraw it which means content will not be visible on the
        Edmond interface any more, but is still retrievable via its original link and/or DOI (together with a
        comment from the submitter why this content is withdrawn).
        On publish, depositors grant Edmond Repository a non-exclusive right to use content deposited in the
        repository, in particular the right to make content publicly accessible on a permanent basis – also for
        downloading.
    </p>

    <h2>License</h2>
    <p>
        During the publishing process within Edmond, there is the possibility to assign a license to the data.
        If no license is assigned, the data will be released under <a
            href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/" target="_blank">CC0</a>. By uploading Content
        to Edmond Repository submitter agrees to and grants third parties the right to use the content on the basis
        of this license.
    </p>
