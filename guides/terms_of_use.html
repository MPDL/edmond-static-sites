        <h1> Terms of Use</h1>

        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>
            Edmond Repository is a service for the publication of research data. It is provided by Max Planck Digital
            Library (MPDL) on behalf of Max Planck Society. Therefore the <a
                href="https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/en/services/tos.html" target="_blank">Terms of Service of the Max Planck
            Digital Library</a> are valid for Edmond. <br />
            Edmond’s aim is to provide a platform for granting access to valuable research data and to promote the
            accessibility of these data. It may be used by uploading content to Edmond Repository (submitter) and by
            downloading (and using) content from Edmond Repository (downloader).
        </p>

        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>
            Edmond is a repository for research data, which is data that is created during scientific research in all
            fields of scholarship. Also negative results and other data that does not lead to a publication are welcome.
            All other sorts of data are not allowed to be uploaded in Edmond. In case it is not clear for you whether
            your data is research data or not, please contact the <a href="#" onclick="_2edmond();return false;" target="_blank">Edmond
            support</a> before depositing the data. If you embed external images in your datasets' descriptions using html, you are responsible for correct copyright use and DSGVO compliance. You must also check whether foreign trade law applies to the publication of the data. This applies in particular to the dual use of data and code. <br /><br />
            MPDL services do not pre-screen any content and are not obliged to do so. As soon as the researcher releases a new dataset, the Edmond support team receives an automated e-mail notification. This triggers manual checks of the content and data format for adequacy. The Edmond support team reserves the right to contact the researcher to request an adjustment of the data. But we reserve the right to delete or remove content without notice from the platform in case it is considered
            inappropriate, not related to scientific research violates the <a
                href="https://www.mpg.de/197494/rulesScientificPractice.pdf" target="_blank">Rules
            of Good Scientific Practice</a>. If a user breaches the terms and conditions even beyond data handling, the data will be withdrawn by the Edmond support team and a notice of non-compliance will be displayed.
        </p>

        <h2>Registration</h2>
        <p>
            The Edmond Service is free of charge for all employees of the Max Planck Society and its scientific project
            partners for data from research projects. It is not allowed to exploit this service for data other than
            those arising from research projects associated with the Max Planck Society.
        </p>

        <h2>Scope of Access</h2>
        <p>
            The aim of putting content into Edmond is to publish it. But it is submitter’s choice to publish the content
            immediately or make it in a first step only available to specific users including authors/right-holders and
            explicitly named users like publishers. These users can at a minimum view and download the data.
            Content, once published, will be kept and made available for at least ten years. Once published, submitter
            has no possibility to erase the content but may withdraw it which means content will not be visible on the
            Edmond interface any more, but is still retrievable via its original link and/or DOI (together with a
            comment from the submitter why this content is withdrawn).
            On publish, depositors grant Edmond Repository a non-exclusive right to use content deposited in the
            repository, in particular the right to make content publicly accessible on a permanent basis – also for
            downloading.
        </p>

        <h2>License</h2>
        <p>
            During the publishing process within Edmond, there is the possibility to assign a license to the data.
            If no license is assigned, the data will be released under <a
                href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/" target="_blank">CC0</a>. By uploading Content
            to Edmond Repository submitter agrees to and grants third parties the right to use the content on the basis
            of this license.
            Edmond is not able to monitor the reuse of the data in accordance with the license outside Edmond. If the Edmond support team becomes aware of an improper use of the data, an attempt will be made to apply the license conditions. If this is not successful, the Edmond support team will decide on further actions together with the data creator.
        </p>

        <h2>Operation</h2>
        <p>
            The Edmond Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Its operators agree to:
            <ul style="list-style-type: square; padding:0 0 0.5em 2%">
                <li> Assist and consult you during the publishing process of your data.</li>
                <li> Store your data on servers in Germany (currently at the <a href="https://www.gwdg.de/"
                                                                                   target="_blank"> Gesellschaft fuer
                    wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH Goettingen (GWDG)).</a>
                </li>
                <li> Take care that your data is regularly backed up.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Questions about the Terms of Use should be sent to: <a id="_2edmond" href="#" onclick="_2edmond();return false;" target="_blank">
            <img id="_2edmondImage" src="/logos/images/_2edmond.svg"/></a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Long-term Preservation</h2>
        Once the data is published in Edmond, the Dataverse storage design as well as the GWDG infrastructure ensure the data availability for at least ten years. If researchers wish to retain the data beyond the specified 10-year period, the data will be transferred to an appropriate archive. Within the <a href="https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3493470_1/component/file_3493471/content" target="_blank">guideline for long-term archiving in Edmond</a> researchers are informed about the data requirements for long-term data preservation and transfer to an appropriate archiving solution.
